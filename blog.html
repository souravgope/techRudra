                    <p>The world is in a state of flux and we need to change too. An educational institution is meant to transform an individual into a value oriented, progressive and dutiful citizen.
                    It is my endeavour to bring R.S.More College Govindpur to the limelight and pave  the way to becoming a model college with goals of excellence, knowledge and perseverance. Education imparted in this college shall usher in a total development of personality of students and help them become successful in life so that they may contribute positively to the development of the society. Modern means of education and the use of Information Communication Technology with well equipped classrooms shall be provided to students and teaching and learning shall be made available to the remotest corners from where the students come. Online education shall be a part of the curricula so that students and teachers may be in touch with each other more closely and without barriers of time, space and distance. Extra-curricular activities and co-curricular activities like sports, cultural programmes, National Service Scheme and National Cadet Corps shall be made an intrinsic part of education in this College and each student shall be given proper attention without discrimination on any basis. Gender equality with provision of grievance redressal shall be given priority and a cordial atmosphere shall prevail in the campus of the College. The College fraternity shall cater to the needs of quality education to the students and social welfare of the villages adopted by NSS unit of the College. In all, the College shall be an arena of character building, personality development, knowledge sharing and skill development.
